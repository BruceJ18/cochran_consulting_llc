            The interesting thing about the Z-Score is that it is a good 
            analytic tool no matter what shape your company is in. Even 
            if your company is very healthy, for example, if your Z-Score 
            begins to fall sharply, warning bells should ring. Or, if your 
            company is barely surviving, your can use the Z-Score to help 
            evaluate the projected effects of your Enhancing efforts.

            Everything has a value. Putting value in dollar terms is the 
            cornerstone not only of running a business but also of investing 
            in almost any form. Knowing how to arrive at a value for the 
            physical and intrinsic characteristics of a business is essential 
            to building wealth of all kinds. To that end, people who invest 
            in companies need to look beyond the current state of the 
            business they own (or want to own).
