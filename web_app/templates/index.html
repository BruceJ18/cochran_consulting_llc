            <p class="e-info-background" id="e1-background-info">
                Entrepreneurs considering Entering business ownership were previously known as
                buyers. We now refer to them as Entering entrepreneurs because there are many effective
                opportunities to become the owner of a business in addition to buying a business.

                A successful Business Enhancement Plan
                is the plan of action that accomplishes the needed objectives indicated in the 
                Evaluation Report. Our Primary Business Consultant will lead in the design of 
                this plan and monitor each step in the accomplishment of increased cash flow.

            <p class="e-info-background" id="e4-background-info">     
                At some point, the owner of every business will consider 
                an Exit Strategy to cash in on years of hard work and investment. 
                If you have a current interest in Exiting your business, or 
                considering maximizing the value of your business for a future 
                Exit, this is an excellent time to make your move.
