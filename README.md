# Cochran Consulting LLC Web App

New repository of Cochran Consulting LLC web application due to some sort of data corruption or
"bad tree object.".

In a way this is perfect because in my last repo I used AWS S3 and a Cloudfront Distribution to deploy only the front end.
I can now utilize an AWS EC2 instance, choosing the appropriate image, along with a AWS ELB and a Amazon NoSQL database to deploy this
full stack web app.
